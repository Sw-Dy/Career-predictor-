Career Path Predictor - README

Overview

Career Path Predictor is a machine learning-based application designed to assist individuals in discovering suitable career paths based on their interests, skills, and responses to a series of questions. This project utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and user-friendly interfaces to provide precise and insightful career recommendations.

The repository includes all the necessary files for training, predicting, and deploying the career prediction model. It is intended for researchers, developers, and students aiming to explore or enhance career recommendation systems.



Features

1. **Career Prediction**  
   The system predicts the most suitable career path based on input data provided by the user, such as skills, interests, and aptitude test scores.

2. **Model Training**  
   Customizable training scripts allow users to retrain the model with their own data using the `training.py` script.

3. **Pre-trained Models**  
   Includes a pre-trained machine learning model (`career_path_model.pkl`) and label encoders (`label_encoders.pkl`) for instant usage.

4. **Data Flexibility**  
   Users can upload their own datasets to personalize and optimize the model for specific use cases.

5. **Easy Integration**  
   The project provides modular code files like `app.py` for API integration and `predictor.py` for seamless prediction capabilities.
